    <h1>Interactive Turing Machine - Help</h1>
    In our application we have four main parts:
    <ul>
        <li>A menu bar at the top with an <a href="#import">import button</a>, an <a href="#export">export button</a>, a <a href="#interaction-modes">button to change the interaction mode</a> and a button to open this page.</li>
        <li>A <a href="#graph">graph</a></li>
        <li>A <a href="#tape">tape</a></li>
        <li>A <a href="#control-buttons">Turing machine control panel</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="graph">Graph</h1>
    
    The graph is the central part of the application <img src="./img/helpPage/graph.png" alt="State" height="42">. In that part, you can draw a state machine. 

    You can pan the graph by dragging the background of the graph. To go back to the initial position of the graph, click on the top left button: <img src="./img/helpPage/recenter-graph.png" alt="State" height="42">.
    
    <div class="section-title">
        <img src="./img/helpPage/state-node.png" alt="State" height="42">
        <h2 id="node">Node</h2>
    </div>
    A node in the graph represents a state of the Turing machine. 
    
    When you click on the node, a pop up appears. In that popup you can change:
    <ul>
        <li>the name of the state;</li>
        <li>if the state is final, i.e. if the Turing machine stops when reaching this state. When the state is final, the node will looks like <img src="./img/helpPage/state-node-final.png" alt="Final State" height="42">;</li>
        <li>delete the state.</li>
    </ul>

    When the Turing machine is running, the node of the current state will looks like :<img src="./img/helpPage/state-node-current.png" alt="Current State" height="42">.

    To set a state as an initial state, draw a transition from the <a href="#generator">generator</a> to the node.

    <div class="section-title">
        <img src="./img/helpPage/generator.png" alt="State" height="42">
        <h2 id="generator">Generator</h2>
    </div>
    When linking a node to the generator, the corresponding state will be set as the initial state of the machine.

    <h2 id="transition">Transition</h2>
    Between two nodes, you can draw one edge. One edge correspond to one or more transitions in between the two corresponding states. If the edge represents one transition only, it would looks like <img src="./img/helpPage/transition.png" alt="State" height="42">, if the edge represents two transitions or more, it would look like <img src="./img/helpPage/transition-thicker.png" alt="State" height="42">.

    When you click the edge, you can set for each corresponding transition:
    <ul>
        <li>the symbol to read from the tape to go through this transition;</li>
        <li>the symbol to write on the tape when going through this transition;</li>
        <li>the movement of the head of the tape to do after going through this transition;</li>
        <li>delete the transition.</li>
    </ul>



    <h1 id="tape">Tape</h1>
    The tape is the bottom left part of our application <img src="./img/helpPage/tape.png" alt="State" height="42">. It can be dragged and scroll. It contains cells <img src="./img/helpPage/cell.png" alt="State" height="42">. If you click on a cell, you can set one character as the content of the cell.

    At the left of the tape you can see two buttons <img src="./img/helpPage/tape-buttons.png" alt="State" height="42">: 
    <ul class="image-list">
    <li><img src="./img/helpPage/import-tape.png" alt="State" height="42">: The first one allow you to input a string to fill the tape. Each character of the string provided will fill one cell.</li>
    <li><img src="./img/helpPage/reset-head.png" alt="State" height="42">: The second one allows you to recenter the tape at the current cell, i.e. the next cell that the Turing machine will read.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h1 id="control-buttons">Turing Machine Control Panel</h1>
    The Turing machine control panel is the bottom right part of our application <img src="./img/helpPage/control-buttons.png" alt="State" height="42">.
    The three buttons from left to right correspond to:
    <ul class="image-list">
        <li><img src="./img/helpPage/run-button.png" alt="State" height="42">: Run the Turing machine until it crashes, arrives to a final state or did 1000 steps.</li>
        <li><img src="./img/helpPage/run-one-step-button.png" alt="State" height="42">: Run the Turing machine for one step.</li>
        <li><img src="./img/helpPage/reset-button.png" alt="State" height="42">: Reset the Turing machine.</li>
    </ul>



    <h1>Import/Export</h1>
    In the menu bar at the top, you can see two buttons: Import and Export.
    <h2 id="import">Import</h2>
    The import button is used to load a Turing Machine from a JSon.
    <h2 id="export">Export</h2>
    The export button is used to export the current Turing machine as a JSon




    <h1 id="interaction-modes">Interaction Mode</h1>
    In our application, we support two interaction types: mouse interaction and Pen & Touch interaction.

    <h2>Mouse Interaction</h2>
    In the mouse mode, you will see on the side of the <a href="#graph">graph</a> a tool bar with two tools <img src="./img/helpPage/tool-bar.png" alt="State" height="42">:
    <ul class="image-list">
        <li><img src="./img/helpPage/node-tool.png" alt="State" height="42">: The first one is the node tool. With that tool you can: 
            <ul>
                <li>Add a node by clicking on the graph</li>
                <li>Move a node by dragging a node</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><img src="./img/helpPage/edge-tool.png" alt="State" height="42">: The second one is the edge tool. With that tool you can: 
            <ul>
                <li>Add a transition by dragging from one node to another</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pen & Touch Interaction</h2>
    In the pen & touch mode:
    <ul>
        <li>By using your finger you can: <ul>
                <li>Add a node by clicking on the graph</li>
                <li>Move a node by dragging a node</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>By using the pen you can: <ul>
                <li>Add a transition by drawing a line from one node to another</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
